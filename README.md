# Tenna-silliness-in-Python
You'll need preferably the latest version of Python anything that isn't too old should work too
you'll need the webbrowser module for this, if it isn't installed run "pip install webbrowser" in your terminal to install it.
This is my first repository, I'm not too well versed in Python, if you'd like to work on something with me or just want a friend then my Discord is "office_drop_ceilingalt0437" I love meeting new people and I'd love to meet you!
